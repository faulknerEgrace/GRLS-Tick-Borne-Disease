# GRLS-Tick-Borne-Disease
Golden Retriever Lifetime Study

The Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS) from the Morris Animal Foundation is a prospective, observational cohort study focused on identifying risk factors for canine cancer and other canine diseases. This unique cohort is comprised of over 3,000 golden retrievers from across the US that are followed throughout their lifetime in attempts to identify genetic, dietary and environmental exposures. The dogs in this cohort were enrolled within their first 2 years of age and every year, their owners and veterinarians have submitted surveys about their lifestyle and health. Using the Morris Animal Foundation GRLS data commons, I have accessed these data with an interest in describing canine tick-borne disease (TBD) reporting.
